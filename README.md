# Subspace System Identification for Predicting Electricity Output (on Solar Data of DAU)

## Overview
This project focuses on the application of **subspace system identification** techniques to predict the electricity output (Eac) of a solar energy system based on temperature data. Unlike general machine learning models, subspace identification offers advantages in terms of system modeling, especially for dynamic and time-series data like that in solar energy systems.

## Why Subspace Identification?
Subspace identification is used in this project because it provides a more structured approach to model dynamic systems, particularly when dealing with time-series data. It can capture the underlying system dynamics with fewer data requirements and better interpretability compared to traditional machine learning models. This technique also allows for:

- **Reduced Complexity**: Less dependency on large amounts of data.
- **Improved Interpretability**: It provides insights into the system's behavior, which is crucial for understanding energy systems.
- **Efficient Model Building**: Suitable for systems where the relationship between input and output is governed by underlying physical dynamics.

## Use Case
This project is applicable to **solar energy systems**, where temperature affects the electricity output. By using subspace identification, the model attempts to uncover the underlying dynamics between temperature (input) and electricity output (Eac, output), leading to more efficient predictions and better system optimization.

## Key Insights
- **Modeling System Dynamics**: Subspace identification provides a clear representation of how temperature influences electricity output, offering a more systematic and insightful approach than black-box machine learning models.
- **Data Efficiency**: Compared to traditional machine learning models, subspace identification requires fewer data points for effective system modeling.
- **Predictive Power**: The model helps in forecasting electricity output under varying temperature conditions, which is vital for optimizing solar energy production.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing algorithms and models.
- **NumPy, Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib, Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning techniques comparison.
